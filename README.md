# EatTrack

## Description

The website offers users the ability to track their nutritional intake throughout the day, helping them maintain a balanced diet. It provides a daily requirements calculator that takes into account information such as weight, height, age, gender, and physical activity level of each user to provide personalized recommendations.

Furthermore, users have the option to add foods to a common database. This allows them to contribute to the enrichment of the database by adding foods that are not already listed. They can also record the foods they have consumed by specifying the exact quantity. This enables them to keep an accurate journal of their daily food intake and better understand their overall nutritional intake.

With these features, the website offers users a convenient and effective way to monitor their diet, calculate their daily nutritional needs, and maintain a detailed record of their food consumption. This allows them to make informed decisions regarding nutrition and promote a healthy lifestyle.
